## This project is about to find the best approximate for Hamiltonian weight problem

In the first step we reduced the problem to find a max clique in a graph and to find the best approximate for our max clique we used the pmc package.

And in the following step we used Simulated Annealing algorithm along the pmc to help the pmc to find the best approximate for max clique.
